# Nim Life Tips

This is a really simple script to extract a life tip from [the great list by Ideopunk](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life)

Quick example:

    $ ./lifetips

    Possessions
    “Where is the good knife?” If you’re looking for your good X, you have bad Xs.
    Throw those out.

## How to compile it

A nim installation if sufficient:

    $ pwd
    [...]/lifetips

    $ nimble build

    $ ./lifetips

    Compassion
    Don’t punish people for trying. You teach them to not try with you. Punishing
    includes whining that it took them so long, that they did it badly, or that
    others have done it better.
